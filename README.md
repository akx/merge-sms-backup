merge-sms-backup
================

Tools to merge XML files generated by [Carbonite SMS Backup and Restore](sms) into a deduplicated JSON file.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3
* `dateparser`

Usage
-----

* Run `read-files.py` against a directory containing `calls` and `sms` XML files (which may be compressed into .xz):
  `python3 read-files.py Dropbox/Apps/SMSBackupRestore`
  This will generate a potentially large `all.pickle` file.
  
* Run `merge-pickle.py`:
  `python3 merge-pickle.py -i all.pickle -d -p deduplicated.pickle -j data.json`
  (You can leave the `-p ...` parameter out if you don't need the intermediate pickle)
  
:tada: A wild `data.json` appears!
